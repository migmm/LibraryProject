A brief description of your Java, Spring Boot, and PostgreSQL library project. You can include an introduction to your project and its purpose here.

## Technologies Used

- **Java:** We use Java as the main programming language. Make sure you have [Java 17](https://www.oracle.com/java/) installed.

- **Spring Boot:** We use Spring Boot as the framework to build our application. You can learn more about Spring Boot [here](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot).

- **PostgreSQL:** We use PostgreSQL as our relational database. Make sure you have [PostgreSQL 13.4](https://www.postgresql.org/) or higher installed and configured correctly.

- **Gradle:** This project is built with Gradle. You can learn more about Gradle [here](https://gradle.org/).
